# Presentation

A small script that simplifies the backup of an Android phone on Arch Linux. 
It automatically creates a backup file of the phone and pulls all of the device's files to a backup folder.

Make sure USB debugging is allowed on your phone.

# Requirements

This script uses [Android Debug Bridge](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Android_Debug_Bridge) to backup the device. If needed, the [needed package](https://archlinux.org/packages/community/x86_64/android-tools/) can be directly installed by launching the script.
